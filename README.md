*A simple JavaScript SHMUP 2D game engine*

This is still very much a work in progress, as well as being a fun project that I work on in my free time... 

I don't have a lot of free time nowadays, so progress is likely to be slow and sporadic.

For further information, a demo, API docs and more, please visit the [Taka project page](http://jimsangwine.github.com/Taka) on github
